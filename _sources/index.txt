* Improved *AsyncTask* & *IntentService* with Exceptions & result reporting support.
* *L*\ogger that figures out tag itself & logs any object.

  also speaks JSON.
* *ImageFetcher* to asynchronously attach images to ImageViews, with caching,

These features are available on Android 2.2+ & come in an under 300kB jar (â†’0 overengineering).
